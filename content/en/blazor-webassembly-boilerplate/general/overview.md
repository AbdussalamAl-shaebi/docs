## Goals

The goal of this repository is to help developers / companies kickstart their Web Application Development with a pre-built Blazor WebAssembly Boilerplate that includes several much needed components and features.

> Note that this is a frontend / client application only! The backend for this application is available in a seperate repository.
> - Find fullstackhero's .NET 6 Web API Boilerplate here - https://github.com/fullstackhero/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the API Running. Here is FSH Backend - https://github.com/fullstackhero/dotnet-webapi-boilerplate
- Once fullstackhero's .NET 6 Web API is up and running, run the Blazor WebAssembly Project to consume it's services.
