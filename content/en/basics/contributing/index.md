Please note the following steps are applicable only for the `docs` repository.

1. Fork the `docs` Repository to your Github Profile.
2. `[Optional]` Navigate to your newly forked Repository -> Settings -> Secrets.
3. `[Optional]` Here, Add a new Repository Secret with a name `GT_TOKEN`. As for the value, paste in your GitHub Token (https://github.com/settings/tokens)
4. Now, clone this repository locally.
